        <h3>Simple, Elegant Design</h3>
        <p>Based on the principles of simplicty beholding the most beauty, I strive to put simplistic designs first without compromising the content that needs to be delivered. The less distraction for the reader, the more engaged they will be with what you have to say.</p>
        <p>That said, hold on to your hats and dresses folks, because you'll like what you'll see!</p>

    <h2>Ohio Native, Charlotte Transplant</h2>
    <p>My wife and I relocated to Charlotte in the fall of 2016. We were in search of a fresh start away from our home, away from the cold winters, and in a newer culture with a bustling economy.</p>
    <p>And so, we ended up in Charlotte.</p>
    <p>Moving allowed me more time to study and focus on the important things such as building a career for myself. Through many hours of studying, building, designing, messing up, and trying again, I have come to learn my newly acquired trade with a good bit of humility and tough lessons. Yet, I still have a ways to go in this industry of lifelong learning and will always be thirsting to fill my brain with something new.</p>

    <h2>Have I Caught Your Attention Yet?</h2>
